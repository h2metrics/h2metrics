h2metrics
=========

What is it?
-----------

This code provides tools for Riemannian shape analysis with second order Sobolev metrics on closed plane curves. It can be used to solve the initial and boundary value problems for geodesics and to compute Karcher means. It is able to factor out reparameterizations, translations, and rotations of the curves. 

For details we refer to the our paper

Dependencies
------------

* MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox
* MATLAB Optimization Toolbox
* Manopt library, available at www.manopt.org. (Only needed to compute Karcher means.)

The code was tested on MATLAB R2014b with Manopt 2.0. 

Installation
------------

The Manopt library must be on the Matlab search path. 

Usage
-----

See the file "example.m" for an example of how to use the code.
